        <p><i>1.They are easier to take care of.</i></p>

        Cats can be indoor or outdoor and there is no need for walks. Most cats do not constantly ask for human
        attention. Cats are pretty lazy in general since they like to sleep for 16 hours a day. Even playing with cats
        is easy. Cats curiosity allows you to play with them even with a crumpled piece of paper rolled into a ball.</p>

        <p> <i>2. Cats are low-maintenance </i></p>

        Besides being much cheaper to get, cats are also low maintenance. All they need is a bowl of food, a water bowl,
        a litter box and a little bit of love. According to the ASPA, the annual cat care cost can be $140-$200 less
        compared to dog care cost and this figure is for basic living. With dogs, there are also more costs associated
        with boarding and dog-walking compared to cats.<img

        <p><i>3. They keep the house clean</i></p>
        <p>Cats are strikingly different from dogs in terms of their utility. They are notoriously independent and
            untrainable - as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling" target=_blank> Rudyard Kipling</a>
            would write, the cat is "not a friend, and not a servant," but "the Cat who walks by himself".Rodents and
            pest control is the skill happily mastered by cats.</p>

        <p><i>4. Cats quietly creep around the house</i></p>
        <p>A cat will accept when you have to leave the house. On the other hand, most dogs get upset and destructive.
            This fact alone should override the contribution of dogs have made to the human lives.Cats can easily
            entertain themselves and cater to their needs on their own as you can see in this meme.<img

        <p><i>5. They are litter box trained.</i></p>
        You have to clean up dog poop by picking it up yourself. Cats can do their business in the litter box that is
        easy to clean. Also, it is much easier to potty train cats than it is for dogs. Most dogs often need
        professional training.</p>

        <p><i>6. They can take care of themselves</i></p>

        <p>Cats are a species known for their independence. You can go to work for 8 hours straight and your cat may not
            miss you or at least make a mess of it.Although they love the attention, they are extremely content spending
            time alone. What makes cat better than most pets is that they can become your companion and not a baby
            needing attention all day.</p>

        <p><i>7. No complaints of noise from neighbours</i></p>
        <p>
            Barking and growling are two of the main reasons for people relinquishing dogs to shelters in the US. With
            cats home, you will not have to worry about the neighbours complaining about your pet disturbing their peace
            of mind. Also, cats do not always meow as much as dogs bark. Cats by nature are calmer, so when you have
            people over, they will just watch from a distance (occasionanly, sometimes they just want to feel loved and
            included). When you need your cat to be quiet for a social event, it will.</p>

        <p><i>8. No destruction inside and outside the house</i></p>
        <p>Dogs chew furniture, shoes, and other things in the house that are kept for care. Moreover, they destroy
            things in the yard and garage. Cats also spray in the house and maybe bite and chew with their little mouth.
            But the problems caused by cats can be eliminated easily. One could say a cat can scratch furniture, but
            regular clipping of their nails and adding scratching posts in some corners of your house will solve this
            problem.</p>

        <p><i>9. Cats are diligent at grooming and hygiene</i></p>

        <p> Cats clean themselves, making cleaning them less of a pain. They don't have that anal gland issue the dogs
            have. If you keep the litter box clean and fresh with high-quality litter chances are, no one will ever
            notice that you have a cat. Cats can have their claws whole and they don't slobber while drinking. There are
            breeds of cats that don't shed and I am not talking about hairless cats, there are cats with hair that don't
            shed or shed very less.</p>

        <p><i>10. Cats are better ecological pets</i></p>

        <p>A study reveals that the area of land required to feed a medium-sized dog is 0.84 hectares annually compared
            to a cat which is 0.15 hectares. Another study reveals some shocking facts as it concludes that, domestic
            dogs threaten at least 188 threatened species worldwide.</p>

        <p> <i>11. They don't need much space</i></p>

        <p> Cats can happily live with you in a studio apartment and never want more. Even keeping a single dog needs a
            lot more space.</p>

        <img src="https://rwrant.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Grumpy-Cat-Funny-01.jpg">

        <p><i>12. They are really good mothers</i></p>

        <p>Not only do mother cats nurse their kittens, but they also teach them to use the litter box, how to sharpen
            claws and whatever. For dogs, this responsibility is upon the owners to teach puppies things. Not everybody
            might be able to afford the training assets, grooming tools and professional help needed for dogs.</p>

        <p><i>13. Cat bites are not half as dangerous as dog bites</i></p>

        <p>Dog bites have dramatically risen in number and severity in the past four decades. The average number of
            people dying from dog bites every year is 35. Even mild dog bites cause pain, injury and a huge risk of
            infection. Cats do not pursue people to bite them and their bites cause mild pain. However, cat bites can be
            infectious.</p>

        <p><i>14. Cats do not escape and even if they do, it is not a problem</i></p>
        <p>You can have your cat be an indoor cat and then you don't have to worry about it running away. Dogs have to
            go outside and so it is more likely for them to run away. Dog escaping from the house or yard is a huge
            problem, whereas such a situation is less stressful for cat owners. Leave the cat to walk around the
            neighbourhood and be worry-free because it will come back home.</p>

        <p><i>15. They are cute and funny</i>/p>
        <p>This might seem like an opinion. But the fact that there are thirty times more breeds of dogs than cats and
            yet we have more cat memes than dog memes around the internet tells it all. Cats are cute, cuddly, soft, and
            funny. They can sit on your lap, lick your face, spend time hiding and do cute tricks.</p>

        <p>16. Owning a cat might make you more intelligent.</p>

        <p>Next time someone asks you to defend why cats are better than dogs, lob this fun little fact at them: Cat
            people are smarter than dog people. According to 2017 research published in the Human-Animal Interaction
            Bulletin, self-identified cat lovers tended to have higher intelligence than dog lovers do. (We are less
            outgoing, though.)</p>
